# FilmQueryProject

# Description
This project interfaces a SQL database with a Java codebase to allow users to look up films by ID or keyword search. Upon successful lookup, appropriate objects are created in the DatabaseAccessor for the film(s) and actor(s) matching the user's search parameters which are then fed back to the main app for relevant data to be printed to the screen.


# Lessons Learned
- I am getting much more comfortable deciding which class any given method should go in to best maintain proper encapsulation of a project. Understanding your basic project layout is paramount. 
- Similar to the above, looking at my code and deciding which parts can be moved to separate methods for increased readability is also getting much easier.
- It is very important to proofread and test your SQL queries. Writing them in the command line first before inserting them into Java seems like a good way to go.
